# Yolov3-and-Spark-api
Utilizing yolov3 face recognition as its primary functionality, the system integrates with the sparkdesk-api.
Since the final project integrates the content of the first three projects and the final Spark API call, we use the Flask framework to build multiple projects and implement remote calls between them, so that these functions can be applied in one web. To run the system, we need to open all the projects at the same time and have them run on different network ports at the same time, and then access the ports that the integrated projects are running on in the final project.
